A warm up is needed
after giving the values, we run MC for several times before recording the results

The resson is that, whatever initial condition we impose, the caes is not realistic. All 1/0 means T = 0. All random means T = inf

Recommanded to discard 10% of the calculations

One sweep is N times of computation, which corresponds to 1 flip for each site on average. 

After each sweep, we record a total energy H, so that they can be used at the end of the MC.


We need to compute the average spin and plot it agains T to find the critical temperature. Doing the same for heat capacity will have a different curve that is peaked at T_c.

Each point should be calculated multiple times to give an estimate of the error.
